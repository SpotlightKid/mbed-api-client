# mbed-api-client

A client for the [mbed compile API] that allows to compile a repository on
http://developer.mbed.org/ or a program in your workspace with the mbed 
[online compiler] and download the compiled firmware.

This version is based on the [mbed API helper] script and was cleaned up
and extended somewhat.
